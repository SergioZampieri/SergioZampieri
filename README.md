## About Me

I'm Sergio, a software developer with a passion for creating solutions to problems and helping people with technology.

I am a continuous learner, always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I strongly believe that collaboration is key in the tech industry and I am eager to work with like-minded individuals to tackle challenging projects and drive innovation. In my leisure time, I enjoy exploring and experimenting with new technologies and finding creative ways to apply them.

With expertise in JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Express, NodeJS, SQL, and a deep understanding of SCRUM methodologies, I bring a well-rounded skill set to any project. My proficiency in these technologies allows me to deliver high-quality and efficient solutions, while my understanding of SCRUM ensures that the development process runs smoothly and efficiently. Whether working on a small task or a complex project, I am committed to delivering results that meet and exceed expectations
